A lightweight Kubernetes engine that deploys `k3s` clusters declaratively based on a cluster configuration file. The name is an abbreviation for _k3s engine_ and a hommage to the German word for cheese, _Käse [ˈkɛːzə]_.

**🐉 Here be dragons:** As the version indicates, this is experimental software. The API is subject to change and there are no stability guarantees. Use at your own risk. We recommend to have a disaster recovery strategy in place.

## Quickstart 💡

If you want to test `k3se` you can use [Vagrant][website-vagrant]. All examples in the `examples/` folder can be used with the provided `Vagrantfile` that provisions 3 Ubuntu VMs. To bring up the VMs you can run the following command:

```bash
$ make vagrant-up
```

Once you are done testing, you can destroy the VMs with the following command:

```bash
$ make vagrant-down
```

## Prerequisites 📝

The nodes have to be accessible via SSH, either directly or via a bastion host. Further, the user on the remote nodes needs to have passwordless `sudo` set up. If this is not yet the case, you may manually do so via the following command:

```bash
$ echo "$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/$(whoami)
```

## Limitations 🚨

The following features are currently not supported, but are planned for future releases:

- **Downsizing**  
  If nodes are removed from the cluster configuration, they are not decommissioned. We plan to enable this feature in the future; performing operations similar to `kubectl cordon` and `kubectl drain` automagically.
- **Diffing**  
  Using the `git` history of the cluster configuration to display potential actions that can be taken to bring the cluster up to date with the configuration.
